I apologize for the confusion. You're absolutely right, and I thank you for catching that error. Let me correct the scoring based on the reverse rules:

Your move: Paper
My move: Rock

In reverse rules, Paper loses to Rock.

Corrected Score:
You: 1
Me: 1

I made a mistake in awarding points in the previous round. In reverse rock paper scissors:

    Rock beats Paper

    Scissors beats Rock
